Place the product images used by the Canteen dashboard in this folder.
Expected filenames (used by the code):

- shirt.png      (displayed as "Shirt")
- drink.png      (displayed as "Drink")
- book.png       (displayed as "Book")
- a4_bundle.png  (displayed as "A4 bundle")

Put PNG (or JPG) images with these exact filenames in this folder. If using a bundler that serves static assets from `public/` move them there or update the paths in `src/pages/CanteenDashboard.tsx` accordingly.
